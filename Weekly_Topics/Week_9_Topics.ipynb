        "Note that some objects, like ArrayLists will require you to use wrapper classes instead of primitives, and that wrapper classes cannot be used with operators in the same way that primitives can be.  That said, java goes through a process called boxing and unboxing (implemented in Java 5) that will automatically convert between primitives and wrapper classes in a number of cases, so it may appear that they are interchangeable: https://howtodoinjava.com/java/basics/java-wrapper-classes/\n",
