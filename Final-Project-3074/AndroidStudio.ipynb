When you do this, it may prompt you to increase the heap size or perform other tuning to make the application run better.  It's probably a good idea to do so, unless it would interfere with other applications running on your machine.\n",

Basically, this is a nosql DB which can store our game state, allowing players in the same game to write to it (they don't know this is what they're doing, the app does this for them) saving and updating the game state.  This is a SUPER SIMPLE way to save a very simple game state, and hopefully will work for our app, we'll see.\n",
